    Boiling Azeotrope

    What is azeotrope? - It is basically mixture of two component A and B (or any two comp.) which doesnâ€™t give partial
    pressure like ideal mixture of two components. In azeotrope mixture the mixture exerts less or more pressure than
    ideal solution (or they are non-ideal solution).

    If mixture exert less pressure, then it will need more heat or temperature to generate vapors to exert equal
    pressure to atmospheric pressure (boiling start when mixture start to exert pressure equal to atmospheric pressure)
    and it is called NEGATIVE MIXING AZEOTROPE or MAXIMUM BOILING AZEOTROPE. Molecules of both components hold each
    other very strong that they are not able to become vapors(evaporation).

    And opposite of NEGATIVE MIXING AZEOTROPE in POSITIVE MIXING AZEOTOPE OR MINIMUM BOILING AZOTROPE the pressure
    exerted by mixture is more than an ideal solution of those comp. So, we will need less temp or heat to get the
    mixture to exert the atmospheric pressure. Molecules of both components hold each other very loosely that they
    become vapors(evaporation) easily.
